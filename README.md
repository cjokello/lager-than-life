# Lager Than Life üç∫

(https://cjokello.github.io/lager-than-life/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This SPA pulls in data from the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). 

## Filters:
There are only two filters in the app:
* [Alcohol by volume (ABV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume)

* [Hoppiness (IBU)](https://www.thebrewenthusiast.com/ibus)

You may filter the beers based on either one or a combination of both. 

Hover over the cards to reveal the name of the beer, its tagline, a detailed description and food pairings for you enthusiasts and connoisseurs.
